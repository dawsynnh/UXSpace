A lightweight webserver framework with SSL support running on Python3 [PHP support using PHP Builtin]

How to use? It depends on what you want to do with it!

The base requirements for this software though are:
1. Python
2. PhP
3. Mysql

You can do some tweaking to get everything set up correctly.
You can use PHP in either CGI mode, as well as this software will automatically start a PHP built-in service if you so desire!

I do recommend creating your own SSL files instead of using these publicly shared ones, but they are just a tool to help get you on your way!
Feel free to mod this program and publish your own version of it!

I mostly made this for fun but if someone finds use in its simplicity then great! :)
